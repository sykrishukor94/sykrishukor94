- 👋 Hi, I’m Shuk @sykrishukor
- 👀 I’m currently a researcher at Genocea developing immunotherapies. When I'm not in lab, I am analyzing biological data for internal and external use
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data science, focusing on R, Python, and MySQL. Eventually I'd like to transition into Bioinformatics/Data Analyst/Data Scientist positions, focusing on my niche and expertise in biotech and healthcare
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Biostatistics/Bioinformatics projects (NGS data, immunogenicity data, algorithm development, statistical tools).
